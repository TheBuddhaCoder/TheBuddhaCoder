- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheBuddhaCoder
- 👀 I’m interested in coding obviously.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and css but I've already learned some basic C++!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others in my coding group on a community garden website!
- 📫 How to reach me: not to be rude but don't as this is a private group project.
- 🤗 Thank You, Github!
